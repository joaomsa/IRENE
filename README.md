# IRENE: Interference and High Availability Aware Microservice-Based Applications Placement for Edge Computing

This repository contains the assets for IRENE, a genetic algorithm based approach that aims at providing satisfactory placements regarding performance interference and SLA violations for microservice-based applications in Edge Computing environments. IRENE was published at CLOSER'20 conference, so if you want to get the fulltext, you can find it at SciTePress. 

## Abstract

The adoption of microservice-based applications in Edge Computing is increasing, as a result of the improved maintainability and scalability delivered by these highly-distributed and decoupled applications. On the other hand, Edge Computing operators must be aware of availability and resource contention issues when placing microservices on the edge infrastructure to avoid applications' performance degradation. In this paper, we present IRENE, a genetic algorithm designed to improve the performance of microservice-based applications in Edge Computing by preventing performance degradation caused by resource contention and increasing the application's availability as a means for avoiding SLA violations. Experiments were carried, and the results showed IRENE effectiveness over different existing strategies in different scenarios. In future investigations, we intend to extend IRENE's interference awareness to the network level.
